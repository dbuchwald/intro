# Introduction

This folder contains sample code for minimal Hello World ES6 Node.js application with Jest tests that can be properly debugged in VSCode. 

## Initial setup

To play with it start with installation of dependencies by running

```
npm install
```

## Running application

To run the application, invoke:
```
npm start
```

## Running tests

Run the tests using Jest by invoking (assuming Jest is installed globally by `npm install -g jest`):

```
jest --coverage
```

or, if you prefer, use npm runner (does not require global Jest installation):

```
npm test
```
